SubSetSum


SubSetSum is a variant of Knapsack where given an array, we need
to check whether there is a Subset that can provide a given sum.

For eg::

Given array:: [1,2,3] and sum:5
We need to check whether there exists a subset within array that
provides us the sum 5.
For eg here 2,3 can provide the sum5.

First approach is BackTracking using Recursion.
It has O(2^n) which is prohibitive in performance.
However, for my practice I would like to write Recursive Code first.
