This is for bounded knapsack.
We're trying to maximize the profit.
This is recursive approach for knapsack.

We've 2 arrays provided
1) Weight Array which is the weight of each item that comprises an array w[]
2) Value array which provides the value that the item has val[]

In addition to the 2 arrays, we're provided a Knapsack capacity W.

We need to find the maximum profit when keeping these items inside the knapsack not exceeding capacity W.
This is the 0/1 knapsack problem where there is no option for fractional items.

Choice Diagram
----------------

To solve this recursively we need to think in this direction.
Imagine we've the knapsack has W=10 and the item value w1=11.
In this case, we can't include the item in the knapsack.
The counterpoint where the knapsack capacity is zero also is valid. These will form our boundary conditions.

At each choice point, we will need to think whether the item can be included or not, which is a choice diagram.

                                        Choice diagram
                                             W=7,val=0
                                    if(w[i]<W)    if (w[i] > W) [Can't be included]
                                        /   \            \
                                       /     \            \
//Increase the value val[i]   val=val+val[i] X              X
// Or not include                 W=W-w[i] //Decrease the existing capacity of Knapsack with weight of item

In the case where we would not like to include the value even if the weight is less than capacity basically is decided by recursion.
In recursion the next set of steps decide whether the current value arrived at is optimal or not.
The max is between 2 series of recursions one with including and one without including.
These are two choices to be made.

We need to convert this choice diagram into recursive code. Later the recursive code can be converted to DP based code.
n:size
int knapSack( int w[], int val[],int n, int W){

        if(W==0||n==0) //Think of the smallest valid input :: Base Condition
            return 0;
//Choice Diagram Code
        if(w[n-1] <= W){
        return Math.Max((val[n-1]+knapSack(w,val,W-w[n-1],n-1)),knapsack(w,val,W,n-1));
        }
        else{
            return knapSack(w,val,W,n-1);
        }
}

Time Complexity :: O(2^n) n being the number of elements
The above method still needs some modification. Since in recursion there are multiple calls which are similar
it would be prudent to apply memoization. Which is smart recursion or DP.We can use a table.

We can modify to DP in the following manner.
We need to identify the state variants. The variants here are capacity and number of the item.
We first need to create array mem[][].
This will be used to store the immediate results. The time complexity now will be size of table size.

int knapSackRecursiveDP(int w[],int val[],int n, int W){

}
